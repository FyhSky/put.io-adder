Put.io Magnet Handler for OS X
==============================

"Put.io adder" is a small OS X app, that adds a new handler for "magnet:" URL schemes, so that every time you click
on a "magnet:" link, the app opens, and adds the clicked link to your [put.io](http://put.io/) download queue.

Please [report issues](https://github.com/nicoSWD/put.io-adder/issues) you may encounter. Pull requests are also very welcome!

**NOTES**
- The app requires you to have a [put.io](http://put.io/) account. They're probably not free anymore.
- The app requires KeyChain Access to store put.io's OAuth Token. Denying access might prevent the app from working.
