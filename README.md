## Put.io magnet: and .torrent Handler for OS X

*put.io adder* is a small, open source app for OS X, that registers as new handler for **magnet** URI schemes, so that every
time you click on a manget link, it will automatically add it to your [put.io](http://put.io/) download queue.

Version 1.4 and above now automatically upload .torrent files you choose to open with the app, and add them to the download
queue as well. There are three ways to do that:

- Drag the .torrent file onto the app icon
- Make *put.io adder* your default handler for .torrent files
- Or right click the torrent and pick "Open with" > put.io adder

**NOTES**
- The app requires you to have a [put.io](http://put.io/) account. They're probably not free anymore.
- The app requires KeyChain Access to store put.io's OAuth Token. Denying access might prevent the app from working.

*IMPORTANT:* I added [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking), [PutioKit](https://github.com/PutioKit/PutioKit), and [SSKeyChain](https://github.com/samsoffes/sskeychain) as submodules.
